<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

It's a templating engine that fills template variables with values from provided .env file. 
<br/>
It was designed to work well for my docker-compose deployment of that <a href="https://github.com/HiveBeats/ServiceQueueBackendEF">Backend project</a>


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Install
Download the latest binary from the releases page. For example, in order to download version 0.0.2 of this plugin run the following step:\
```sh
curl -LO https://github.com/HiveBeats/denver/releases/download/v0.0.2/denver.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xfz denver.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Install the binary if you want to:
```sh
cp bin/denver /usr/bin/
```
### Usage
To use this tool you need two things:
 - provide a path for .env file with *-e* argument
 - provide a path for template text file with *-t* argument

Example:
```sh
./denver -e ./test/.env -t ./test/template.txt
```
Result will be visible in that template.txt

### Development

The project is built with **Make**. To build a release version, simply use:
```sh
make
```

Also, Visual Studio Code tasks to build and debug with GCC are attached. 

*build.sh* and *test-prc.sh* scripts here to test the project locally with clang.
